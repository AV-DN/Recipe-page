      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Beat the eggs: In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water or milk for a fluffier texture.</li>
        <li> Heat the pan: Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat and add butter or oil.</li>
        <li>Cook the omelette: Once the butter is melted and bubbling, pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the surface.</li>
        <li>Add fillings (optional): When the eggs begin to set at the edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen fillings over one half of the omelette.</li>
        <li>Fold and serve: As the omelette continues to cook, carefully lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another minute, then slide it onto a plate.</li>
        <li> Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.</li>
      </ol>
